Welcome!
========

If there's a feature or anything you think is missing, please either a.) open an issue to request the feature or b.) develop the feature yourself and put in a pull request. Pull requests should be written in the same style as the existing code base.

If you're interested in (and serious about) writing an addons, I'll do what I can to implement the APIs you need. Up until this point I've only been implementing what I've needed.
